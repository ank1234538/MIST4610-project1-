# Problem Description
The Venue Management Database is designed to simplify and optimize the day-to-day operations of an event venue. It enables managers to efficiently track revenue, monitor venue capacity, and manage ticket distribution per guest. By consolidating these processes into one system, the database improves accuracy, reduces manual effort, and generates insights that support smarter business decisions. In turn, it helps the venue deliver a smooth, enjoyable experience for guests while maintaining strong financial performance and resource utilization.
